			<h2> 10th Prime Minister of India</h2>

			<p><b>Atal Bihari Vajpayee (1924-2018)</b> was an Indian politician and statesman who served as the Prime Minister of India three times - for a short period in 1996, and then for two full terms from 1998 to 2004. He was a leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), one of the two major political parties in India.

				Vajpayee was born on December 25, 1924 in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh. He studied at Victoria College in Gwalior and at DAV College in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. He was involved in the Indian independence movement, and was briefly jailed in 1942 for participating in a student protest against British rule.
				
				Vajpayee was first elected to the Indian parliament in 1957, and he remained an active politician for over five decades. He served as a member of parliament for several terms, and held various ministerial positions in the Indian government.
				
				As Prime Minister, Vajpayee oversaw significant economic reforms and infrastructure development in India. He also pursued a policy of engagement with Pakistan, and made efforts to improve relations between the two countries. In 1999, he launched a military campaign to push back Pakistani forces from Indian territory in the Kargil War.
				
				Vajpayee was widely respected across the political spectrum in India for his oratory skills, statesmanship, and ability to build consensus. He was also a poet and a writer, and published several collections of his work.
				
				In 2014, Vajpayee was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award. He passed away on August 16, 2018 at the age of 93.
